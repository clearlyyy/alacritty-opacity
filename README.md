#alacritty-opacity

Got Tired of changing opacity through the .yml file.

This Automates the process for you with a simple command!

add the "opacity" file to your $PATH variable, make sure loc.opacity is in the same dir as it.

Simply run "opacity -loc <alacritty.yml-file-location>"
now your alacritty.yml file location has been saved.

and you can run "opacity <0-100>"
and it will change your terminals opacity, without restarting anything

NOTE:
your alacritty.yml file must have an "opacity: <number>" flag in it already
